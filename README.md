# ProformanceNFT
Proformance (Professional Performing Athlete) - Your Proformance data is your non-fungible tokens aka NFT. Your biometric data is spun off in real-time, whereas, the use of NFTs would enable athletes to track how their data is being used. Athletes can increase the value of their collectible NFTâ€™s by including their Proformance data. An NFT would not only mark off the data as belonging to that professional athlete as a form of identification but also guaranteed ownership, which will enable the athlete to be able to access it and track where it goes, even being able to provide the owner of the data with residual income. This can also be applied to other research initiatives that intends to use athlete-generated data.
